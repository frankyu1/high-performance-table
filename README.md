# High Performance React Table

A high-performance, virtualized table component built with React that can efficiently handle large datasets (10,000 rows) while maintaining smooth scrolling and responsive performance.

## Features

- **Virtual Scrolling**: Only renders visible rows plus buffer rows, dramatically reducing DOM nodes
- **Sortable Columns**: Click column headers to sort data
- **Filtering**: Filter rows by ID with debounced search
- **URL State Management**: Table state (sort, filter) is preserved in URL parameters
